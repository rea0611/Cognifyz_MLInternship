Machine Learning Projects – Regression, Classification & Recommendation Systems

This repository contains practical machine learning projects built on real-world restaurant datasets. Each project focuses on applying core ML concepts with clean code, structured workflows, and measurable evaluation metrics.

📂 Projects
Restaurant Rating Prediction (Regression)
Built Linear Regression and Decision Tree models to predict aggregate restaurant ratings. Performed data cleaning, encoding, train-test split, and evaluated performance using MSE and R².
Restaurant Recommendation System
Implemented a content-based recommendation engine using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to suggest restaurants based on cuisine and price preferences.
Restaurant Cuisine Classification
Developed a Random Forest classifier to predict primary cuisine types using structured features like price range and ratings. Evaluated model accuracy to assess performance.

🧩 Skills Demonstrated
Data preprocessing & feature engineering
Regression and classification modeling
Recommendation systems (content-based filtering)
Model evaluation & interpretation
End-to-end ML pipeline development

🛠 Tech Stack
Python | Pandas | NumPy | Scikit-learn

🎯 Purpose
To demonstrate strong fundamentals in applied machine learning and real-world problem solving through structured, reproducible projects.
